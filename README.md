## Greg and Serge
-   If someone wanted to run our code for the bitmap, follow these steps:
-   Load and save an image into directory where gradle is currently housed
-   Convert the png, jpg, or another image extension into a .bmp (if not already a bmp)
-   From there, clone the repo
-   Import it into IntelliJ
-   Save it
-   Run (ensuring that the image is present in your file directory or included in the clone)
-   Another option would be to use a .bmp of your choosing
-   Always ensure the .bmp is located within file structure with gradle
